%%TO DO: Fix phi hat vectors
Smith Chart:
$${\Gamma} = \frac{Z_L - Z_0}{Z_L+Z_0} ~~ , ~~ Z(z) = Z_0 \frac{Z_L + jZ_0~tan~\beta z}{Z_0 + jZ_L~tan~\beta z}$$
$$ Z(z) = Z_0 \frac{1 + \Gamma_z}{1 - \Gamma_z} $$

Page 175, Microwave Engineering, Pozar: he used reciprocity with no sources, The reson is network contain no active devices. Note that a and b are not power sources but a somewhere in the network having $E_a$ and $E_b$ passthrough them. The discusstion is around a network have all port set to short circuit but only two port are matched and connected to a VNA
