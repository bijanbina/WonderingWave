$$\hat{n} \times ( H_2 - H_1 ) = J_s ~~ , ~~ \hat{n} \times ( E_2 - E_1 ) = \frac{\partial B}{\partial t} ~~ , ~~ \hat{n} \cdot ( B_2 - B_1 ) = 0 ~~ , ~~ \hat{n} \cdot ( D_2 - D_1 ) = \rho $$
If $H_2$ is inside perfect conductor then 
$$ \hat{n} \times H_1 = J_s $$
where $\hat{n}$ is toward \cite{inan} Figure 1.2b. For non perfect conductor as a way in shown in pozar for calculation of power we must assume a countor to infinity and integrate it to where $E$ become zero then we gain an equation similar to $ \hat{n} \times H_1 = J_s $.
