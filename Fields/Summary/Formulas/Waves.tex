Wave number or k is defined as $ k = j \omega \sqrt{\mu \epsilon} $. This definition inspired from Wave Equation in a lossless equation. So for Lossy media it changed to \it{Complex Propagation Constant} or $\gamma$.  The Complex Propagation Constant is splitted into real and imaginary part which the former called attenuation constant or $\alpha$ and the latter is phase constant or $\beta$. note that this definition only apply to TEM mode. Thus in solution to TE and TM Mode, The $\beta$ used to show that the media is lossless but it may or may not be complex.
\par
$\delta$ is an approximation to power loss due to imperfect conductance ($\sigma<<\infty$).
