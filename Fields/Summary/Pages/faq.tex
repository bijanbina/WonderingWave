\textbf{Q:} Why beta can be imaginary?\\
\textbf{A:} Wave number or k is defined as $ k = j \omega \sqrt{\mu \epsilon} $. This definition inspired from Wave Equation in a lossless medium. So for Lossy media it changed to {\it Complex Propagation Constant} or $\gamma$.  The Complex Propagation Constant is splitted into real and imaginary part which the former called attenuation constant or $\alpha$ and the latter is phase constant or $\beta$. note that this definition only apply to TEM mode. Thus in solution to TE and TM Mode, $\beta$ is used to show the media is lossless. So in these mode $\beta$ can be a complex number.
\\\\\textbf{Q:} Find Surface current if $z$ is the propagation direction\\
\textbf{A:} 
$$ J_s =  \int_{0}^{\infty}{ J } \cdot \mathrm{d}\vec{z} = \int_{0}^{\infty}{\sigma E} \cdot \mathrm{d}\vec{z} = \sigma \int_{0}^{\infty}{E_0 e^{-\gamma z}} \cdot \mathrm{d}\vec{z} $$
